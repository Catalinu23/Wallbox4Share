    <string name="about_us">Hello! 👋 We are Bitself, a team of 6 high school students from Cluj, who got together within the Academy Discover your passion in I.T. 😄
Because we are interested in the future of our community, we decided to develop an application that has a positive impact on the environment and facilitates the rapid finding of a charging station for electric cars. 🚗🔌⚡
Sharing is caring, therefore we will encourage electric car owners to help each other by sharing their own Wallboxes. 🤝</string>
